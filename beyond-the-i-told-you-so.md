Recognizing that certain things could be done better is part of human nature. Teams typically face scenarios where one forward-thinking person can anticipate the wrong direction. Likewise, there are situations where the entire team sees the wrong direction from their leadership.

Mature teams are the ones where "I told you so" / "We told you so" is converted into "He told us so" / "They told me so". This type of honesty is akin to a difference between bravado and bravery. Only a brave person is prepared to fall on his/her sword. Accountability is ineffective if it is a post-fact punishment. A form of inspection needs to be `continuously integrated` into life of teams and organisations. Naturally, this is much easier said than done.

Expecting humans to be perfect is unrealistic. Hence, there is no perfect answer. However, such philosophical predicament should not stop us from setting unreachable goals. "You must always live in love with something unreachable... a person becomes taller because he reaches up" - Maxim Gorky.

What works and what doesn't is always going to be specific to personalities and context. The trick is to avoid being stale. Change is the only constant. Continuous inspection based on systemic transparency will brush away wasteful blame or excuses.

It is best not to be dependent on fixed patterns (a.k.a process dogmas). Agile mindset and cultural change are dependent on radical transparency and Kaizen thinking. There is no place for excuses and being stale.
